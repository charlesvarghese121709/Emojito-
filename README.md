##Project Description##:
- Welcome to Emojito â€” a project where we mix up emotions just like making a mojito, and create unique, hybrid emojis! Whether it's laughing while annoyed or crying with excitement, this AI-powered tool generates new, never-before-seen emoji expressions that perfectly capture your complex feelings. It's like stirring together emotions into the ultimate digital cocktail!


##The Problem (That Doesn't Exist)##
- Emojis have become too basic. When you need to laugh and be annoyed at the same time, whereâ€™s your emoji? We demand more nuanced emotional expressions, especially when weâ€™re sending passive-aggressive texts!

##The Solution (That Nobody Asked For)##
- Weâ€™re solving this very important problem by using cutting-edge AI to create hybrid emoji emotions! By generating laughing-yet-annoyed, or crying-yet-excited emojis, we bring the ultimate emotional depth to your digital expressions. Itâ€™s AI magic, combined with fun image post-processing.
